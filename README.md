# RandomSort
Sorts any jpg and png files so when you run a slideshow it's randomly ordered.

Simply run it from the same folder all your pictures are.  It will automatically find all jpg and png files, randomly sort them by renaming them and copy the renamed files to a new sub folder.  It may be useful to make a binary for you platform of choice.

# Requirements
This is written in and requires python 3.x.  It may run in python 2.x but I have no intention of supporting it.  If you've never user python before the quick start/download page is [here](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download).
